    <!-- 2025-09-12 ebb: This is definitely too easy for the complicated task of curating this interesting recipe card!
    * There's a multimedia dimension: You need a photo of the card to work with and make part of the project repo (website too?)
    * You may be voice recording to help with interpreting the recipe.
    * Think about curating metadata about the paper/cardstock, ink/pencil, food smudges(?), gaps, unreadable portions?
    
    * Think about: comment on scoopers vs. gram-scale approaches (Gram was a scooper.)
