# Project File Naming Rules

To keep the "Grandma's Chocolate Cake" digital heritage project organized and easy to navigate, we will follow these simple and consistent file-naming rules.

## General Principles

- **Lowercase**: All file and folder names must be in lowercase.
- **Hyphens**: Use hyphens (-) to separate words. Do not use spaces or underscores (_).
- **Consistency**: Be consistent. If you name a folder `assets`, always refer to it as `assets`.

## Folder Structure

The project repository should have the following root-level folders to keep content separated:

- `docs/`: For all HTML pages (e.g., `index.html`, `main.html`, `recipe.html`).
-     `docs/`: For all CSS stylesheets.
- `xml/`: For all XML files and their corresponding schemas.
- `assets/`: For all images and other media files.

## File Naming Conventions

### HTML Files
- Use a descriptive name that reflects the page's content.  
- **Example**: `index.html`, `about-us.html`, `recipe.html`.

### CSS Files
- Name CSS files based on the HTML page they style, or for a general purpose.  
- **Example**: `main-style.css`, `splash-page.css`.

### XML Files
- XML files should be named for the specific content they contain.  
- **Example**: `grandmas-recipe.xml`, `brand-name-recipe.xml`.

### Schema Files
- Schema files should be named to match the XML file they validate, with the `.rng` extension.  
- **Example**: `grandmas-recipe.rng`.

### Image Files
- Use descriptive names for images.  
- **Example**: `grandmas-chocolate-cake.jpg`, `flour-and-sugar.png`.
