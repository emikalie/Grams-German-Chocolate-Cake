    <h1>Welcome to Grandma’s Chocolate Cake Project</h1>
    <p>
      This project is part of my senior capstone in Digital Media Arts and Technology.
      It’s dedicated to my Grandma Mikula, who taught me how to make her German Sweet Chocolate Cake —
      a recipe passed down through generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this site, I’ve turned her handwritten recipe and family traditions into a digital story —
      combining coding, history, and love. You’ll see the XML model, step-by-step videos, and the sweet results.
