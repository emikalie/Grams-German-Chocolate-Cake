      <h1>Grandma's German Chocolate Cake</h1>
      <h2>A Digital Heritage Project</h2>

      <p>
        This project is part of my senior capstone in Digital Media Arts and Technology (DIGIT).
        It is dedicated to my Grandma Mikula, who taught me how to make her German Sweet Chocolate Cake —
        a recipe that has been passed down through generations and preserved from Grandma’s 2005 handwritten recipe card.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this site, I’ve transformed her handwritten recipe and family traditions into a digital story —
        combining coding, history, and love. You’ll find the original recipe card, step-by-step videos,
        a digitized XML model of the recipe, and documentation of the baking process.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page serves as both the welcome space and the project overview, giving you a sense of the heritage,
        the technology, and the process behind recreating this family dessert in digital form.
